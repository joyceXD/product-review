"description": "The powerful author team of the Horngren/Harrison franchise is comprised of Charles Horngren and Tom Harrison.  Both highly respected professors in academia and in the accounting industry, they joined together to write a text to provide students with a solid foundation of the principles of accounting.   Accounting was the first text to tie accounting concepts to the business reasons behind them.  Charles and Tom recognized that most students will USE accounting information, not simply create it.  In Accounting, the authors talk to the business person or the USER of the accounting information, which engages the non-major, business student. Over the years, the Accounting  franchise became a trusted, tried and true choice for instructors who wanted their students to learn accounting with the traditional framework but with modern application.     For the 8th edition, Horngren and Harrison invited Suzanne Oliver to join the already solid author team.  Suzanne Oliver brings her detailed knowledge of the series from her years of active use of the text in her courses and also as an author of the MyAccountingLab content and instructor resources.  In addition, Suzanne contributes an invaluable element of her teaching experience at community colleges and in varied classroom environments (traditional, hybrid and online). Together, the author team's goal was to retain the traditional, solid accounting foundation of the text while adding a modern Table of Contents and fresh new approach to reach today's students.  This revision of the text further strengthens the textbook component of the Student Learning System and provides consistency for students throughout the text, the study resources and MyAccountingLab.

Each chapter utilizes the same unique case family to explore the intricacies of how that model views the theory of problem formation as well as the theory of problem resolution. Readers will work their way through nine engaging theory chapters written from the perspective of the founder. As theories are presented, the development of a case conceptualization will take shape and a deeper understanding of the unique situation of one case family currently having difficulties will be explored and studied, and a solution as to what course of treatment might be most appropriate will be evaluated.Also from Michael D.

<![endif]&ldquo;Helio Fred Garcia coached me a decade ago on the fundamentals of effective communication. I probably wasn&rsquo;t his best student, but I count what I learned from him as one of the most important contributions to my personal growth as an executive.The Power of Communicationshould be on the must-read list of any person who aspires to lead by capturing the hearts and minds of his or her stakeholders.&rdquo;--Jeffrey Bleustein,Retired Chairman and CEO, Harley-Davidson, Inc.&nbsp;&ldquo;The Power of Communicationis an absolutely terrific book on how to communicate and lead in complex and shifting situations. Helio Fred Garcia has compiled a wealth of compelling examples to illustrate and support a cogent and immensely practical set of principles for leadership communication. The result is a compelling guide for leaders in business and government settings alike.&rdquo;--Amy C. Edmondson,Novartis Professor of Leadership and Management, Harvard Business School, and author ofTeaming: How Organizations Learn, Innovate, and Compete in the Knowledge Economy&nbsp;&ldquo;Helio Fred Garcia is known as one of the most engaging and effective professors at NYU. Readers of this book will learn why. Only Fred could weave together tales about Abbott and Costello, the Marine Corps, and Cicero into a must-read for anyone who hopes to connect with the American public.&rdquo;--Louis Capozzi,Chairman, MSL Group (retired), and Adjunct Professor, New York University&nbsp;&ldquo;Professor Garcia&rsquo;s book is great news for decision-makers, leaders, and professionals in the U.S. and any country in the world.The Power of Communicationcontains some very important global wisdom to save you in crisis in an omni-media age. The pity is that he can visit China only once a year, but that gives us all the more reason to celebrate the publication of this book, a very clear, concise, interesting, and powerful masterpiece.&rdquo;--Professor Steven Guanpeng Dong, Ph.D.,Chair and Director, Institute of Public Relations and Strategic Communications, Tsinghua University, Beijing; Vice President, China Public Relations Association; former Shorenstein Fellow on the Press, Politics, and Public Policy, Kennedy School of Government, Harvard University&nbsp;&ldquo;The Power of Communicationis story after story, insight after insight, lesson after lesson, inspiration after inspiration. Just when you think it&rsquo;s impossible to find another important illustration of a crucial communication or leadership principle, Fred gives you another chapter of powerful, sensible, often surprising and charming stories and lessons. Believe me, he is a persuasive orator in person and, as you&rsquo;ll read, on paper. Looking to build your powers of communication, to inspire trust and confidence, and to lead effectively? You hold in your hand the key ingredient to a happier, more successful, and influential professional life. Start reading.&rdquo;--James E. Lukaszewski,ABC, APR, Fellow PRSA, President, The Lukaszewski Group Division, Risdall Public Relations&nbsp;Communication is the absolutely indispensable leadership discipline. But too often leaders and professional communicators get mired in tactics and fail to influence public attitudes in the ways that would help them most.The Power of Communicationis the solution. World-renowned leadership communication expert Helio Fred Garcia builds on the U.S. Marine Corps&rsquo; legendary publicationWarfighting, showing how to apply the Corps&rsquo; proven leadership and strategy doctrine in all forms of public communication--and achieve truly extraordinary results.&nbsp;Garcia demonstrates how to orient on audiences, recognize their most critical concerns, and successfully communicate on three levels: strategic, operational, and tactical. You&rsquo;ll learn how to take the initiative and control the agenda...respond to events with speed and focus...use the power of maneuver...prepare and plan...and put it all together, becoming a &ldquo;habitually strategic&rdquo; communicator.Communication has power, but, as with any powerful tool, it needs to be used effectively or it can cause significant self-inflicted harm. You&rsquo;ll learn specific, indispensable lessons of leaders communicating effectively, including Apple&rsquo;s Steve Jobs and the McDonald&rsquo;s board, as well as from catastrophic mistakes of business and political leaders who got it wrong, from BP&rsquo;s Tony Hayward to the HP board to FEMA.&nbsp;If you need to win hearts and minds, you needThe Power of Communication--and you need it now.&nbsp;Words matter: taking language seriously as a leadership disciplineAdapt language to changing circumstances and to the reactions they generateWords aren&rsquo;t enoughLearn how what a leader says sets expectations, but what a leader does determines whether trust rises or fallsTake your audience seriouslyConnect with your audiences as living, breathing entitiesSpeed, focus, and capturing the first mover advantageDefine your situation, motives, and actions--before someone else doesSaying it isn&rsquo;t enoughMaster the bearing, physicality, and stagecraft of successful public leadershipAudiences, attention, and retentionLearn how hearts and minds work--and get them to work together for you&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;", "title": "Power of Communication,The: Skills to Build Trust, Inspire Loyalty, and Lead Effectively", "related": {"also_bought": ["0470181540", "0415448980", "1422157296", "1568022115", "0844772259", "1437755887", "0071829318", "1452203873", "0135121035", "1589019164", "1589017048", "0135565642", "1481234706", "0132671409", "0205856330", "0787911070", "0761910077", "0071771328", "0415801850", "0470873949", "0471445819", "1133594808", "1118118804", "0470392509", "0873261437", "0132980932", "007162502X", "1568025505", "0071767460", "0815776799", "0061252662", "0983043620", "1111342806", "0618993010", "0674066952", "0132983214", "1118398629", "0787996181", "0977326403", "0205211674", "0743457579", "0393912728", "1606491016", "1285737237", "1601632088", "0873261798", "0872893480", "023033833X", "0470560452", "1422125076", "0205648282", "0307595919", "073520456X", "0785281118", "0470405309", "0143118757", "1422157970", "1412991315", "157766440X", "0136029698", "1478603402", "1422161986", "1937134679", "0132473984", "1118573331", "0814420303", "0078038243", "1577665791", "0060891548", "0136026885", "0137150695", "0307407705", "0071493042", "1422189864", "0062273205", "0312364695", "0136110584", "157322331X", "0814414036", "0130478229", "1587202832", "1594484805", "0465024092", "0132337177", "0060081996", "0073403318", "0670025658", "0452269423", "0700618929", "0785281126", "0136088902", "0791403920", "1422162516", "1931332576", "0787987999", "0791801624", "0743212347", "0470876360", "1450215165", "0829421157"], "bought_together": ["0470181540", "0415448980"], "buy_after_viewing": ["067162248X", "0785214259", "1451639619", "0071771328"]}, "price": 19.24, "salesRank": {"Books": 433760}, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/61dQ0dZeAcL.jpg", "categories": [["Books"]]}{"asin": "0132855208", "description": "\"The Crosscultural, Language, and Academic Development Handbookis a useful and clearly written text, it is a text that will prove to be resource and guide for practicing teachers.\" -Terah Moore,George Fox University\"Current research is presented in a user-friendly way with excellent real life examples and thought provoking questions/activities.

Worse, because of faulty systems (not personnel), up to 98,000 people die annually due to preventable medical errors&mdash; and that doesn&rsquo;t even count non-terminal events such as hospital-acquired infections.&nbsp;InHospital Operations, two leading Operations Management experts and five practicing clinicians demonstrate how to apply new OM advances and metrics to substantially improve any hospital&rsquo;s performance. Replete with examples,Hospital Operationsshows how to generate principles-driven breakthrough ideas to systematically improve emergency departments, operating rooms, nursing units, and diagnostic units. The authors conclude by previewing the &ldquo;Hospital of the Future,&rdquo; addressing issues ranging from prevention and self-care to emerging technologies and the growing maturity of evidence-based medicine.&nbsp;This unique resource will be indispensable to all healthcare operations managers/executives and related healthcare professionals. Students in hospital management courses will also find sufficient history and institutional knowledge to take full advantage of it without prior knowledge of health care systems.Most health care debates center on the best political and economic structure to promote health and health care. Whether they advocate a centralized, single-payer system, a decentralized market-based system, or anything in between, such debates tend to abstract away from actual hands on medical practice&mdash;a dangerous oversimplification. All the value in any conceivable system is only realized in the actual delivery, when hands touch patients. Everything else is prelude.&nbsp;Hospital Operationsfocuses exclusively on the health care delivery process to generate insights and tools for improving hospital performance regardless of the political or economic environment.

Discusses the risks associated with distributed DBMSs, presents alternative solutions to the major technical problems, points out the major pitfalls of distributed DBMSs, and offers suggestions for avoiding them. Considers three types of textual based systems -- information retrieval, hoovering, and filtering -- and describes various approaches to distributed textual database management systems. Explores multimedia DBMSs that manage a variety of new media types (e.g., text, image, audio, and video data types), describes the special problems introduced by multimedia (e.g., large data objects, continuous temporal data objects, and the problems of synchronization multiple streams of temporal data).

Lewis&#39; efforts led to the creation of Santa Clara University&rsquo;s Computer Engineering department in 1988, providing its leadership for the first 18 years. During his tenure, Lewis established unique co-op and study abroad options that fit within the normal undergraduate four-year plan, the first graduate-level academic certificate programs for working professionals, a new interdisciplinary major in Web Design and Engineering, and a interdisciplinary minor in Information Technology and Society. Since 2004, Lewis has focused on K-12 outreach in engineering and computing, raising more than $1.7M from NSF and private sources, and providing professional development for more than 200 K-12 teachers and summer camps for more than 2,000 K-12 students.Prior to joining the University in 1975, Lewis worked for six years at General Electric&rsquo;s Aerospace Division where he designed a fault-tolerant clocking system for one of the first triple-redundant automatic landing systems for commercial aircraft. He has consulted for a number of Bay Area companies, including the Singer-Link Company, where his design of new algorithms and a corresponding modular array of VLSI circuits became the basis of a new product line of real-time computer graphics systems.", "title": "Fundamentals of Embedded Software with the ARM Cortex-M3", "related": {"also_bought": ["0136114997", "1557427283", "0534390803", "0321385179", "0132139316", "1118140621", "0201128195", "0132316811", "185617963X", "0471127043", "0132129485", "0073380547", "013198926X", "0262033844", "1439871825", "0132856204", "0073380458", "0132923726", "0201590654", "1133628478", "0961392134", "0961392169", "0131103628", "1477508996", "0072468386", "0195323033", "0470458240", "0672315858", "0073309508", "1439877998", "0195371615", "1481272713", "157766082X", "0071639489", "0131019880", "0130411612", "0905705912", "0080982964", "1449638619", "0471386782", "1447717155", "1592449840", "1461431425", "0292705123", "160927492X", "0470618299"], "bought_together": ["1557427283"], "buy_after_viewing": ["0131103628", "0124080820", "1463590156", "1477508996"]}, "price": 33.95, "salesRank": {"Books": 491074}, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51BGzsGbyhL.jpg", "categories": [["Books"]]}{"asin": "0132908425", "description": "This book describes some basic problems in computer graphics and computational geometry, and presents some practical methods for solving them, using these problems and solutions as an introduction to the fields of Computational Geometry and Computer Graphics.

This volume explores&#151;in depth&#151;neo-Taylorism (where it came from and what its beliefs are), Deming's philosophy (his system of profound knowledge and his 14 points), and suggests how Deming's philosophy&#151;if adopted&#151;could be an antidote for today's managerial ineffectiveness.  Shows organization and technical managers how to change&#151;using Deming's principles&#151;in order to improve quality in delivered services and products and in employee satisfaction. Analyzes the flaws of Taylorism and Neo-Taylorism&#151; with point-by-point comparison with Deming's philosophy.

Mark Guzdial is director of the Contextualized Support for Learning at Georgia Tech.&nbsp; Together they have written three textbooks using the MediaComp approach to engage and inspire student learning in computing.&nbsp;The Karlstrom Award recognizes educators who advanced new teaching methodologies; effected new curriculum development in Computer Science and Engineering; or contributed to ACM&rsquo;s educational mission.", "title": "Introduction to Computing and Programming in Python (3rd Edition)", "related": {"also_bought": ["1449672841", "0078036879", "039393313X", "1466568283", "0073401420", "0307594165", "0538735503", "0136001599", "0073383090", "0393934268", "0132828936", "0393928373", "0495391328", "1400030935", "0226139492", "0226294838", "058221288X", "0078022878", "0073405035", "007340182X", "1111969604", "013612934X", "0470665769", "0521776007", "0495110817", "0137135599", "0078111021", "0077292685", "0596158106", "0321385179", "0226116670", "020568517X", "0840049420", "084006862X", "0205053998", "0132783398", "0495572713", "1111534128", "0393912787", "1111990018", "0486602699", "0321597796", "0321567986", "0136060234", "0132149117", "0470503467", "0486477223", "0132936526", "1439079021", "0195314409", "B0018RRSOU", "0596158084", "144933072X", "0470170522", "0312542542", "0538497831", "1587143879", "1118008189", "1111529116", "1118057112", "1429282568", "0582405254", "0073530085", "0132051524", "0195167295", "1429280476", "1118407997", "0133128075", "0840068131", "0073526193", "1890774588", "1936221365", "1441928359", "B0001EMLZ2", "0385121229", "1429208384", "0486268772", "0226065669", "0393322572", "0538453044", "0205012647", "1464101876", "0750661232", "0521796687", "1846380014"], "bought_together": ["1449672841"], "buy_after_viewing": ["0136060234", "1590282418", "0262525003", "0321884914"]}, "price": 31.15, "salesRank": {"Books": 67740}, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51QIu7I6ozL.jpg", "categories": [["Books"]]}{"asin": "0132938944", "salesRank": {"Books": 3210337}, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/91AT%2BfbEkAL.jpg", "categories": [["Books"]], "title": "Excavation and grading code administration, inspection, and enforcement"}{"asin": "0132938057", "title": "NEW MyEconLab with Pearson eText -- Access Card -- for Macroeconomics", "price": 102.69, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/21lmVMuCOYL.jpg", "related": {"also_bought": ["0132832208", "0132951649", "B008YOQKXU", "0536922012", "0133080099", "0073403474", "0132951592", "013281725X", "0136021972", "0132832305", "007747449X", "032119991X", "0691151636", "0078112613", "1887503889", "007802952X", "0078034752", "1285091868", "0742519902", "0321696816", "0415774993"], "bought_together": ["0132832208"], "buy_after_viewing": ["0132832208", "0132951592", "0133020258", "0132951649"]}, "salesRank": {"Books": 399938}, "categories": [["Books"]]}{"asin": "0132837226", "title": "Student DVD (standalone) for The Voice and Voice Therapy", "price": 30.97, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/21hRx5-9HrL.jpg", "related": {"also_bought": ["0133007022", "0323072003", "1608310043", "1401897258", "0137071329"], "bought_together": ["0133007022"], "buy_after_viewing": ["159756530X"]}, "salesRank": {"Books": 3137998}, "categories": [["Books"]]}{"asin": "0132926865", "description": "", "title": "Starting Out with C++: From Control Structures through Objects, Brief Edition plus MyProgrammingLab with Pearson eText - Access Card Package (7th Edition)", "related": {"also_bought": ["158503780X", "0321696867", "0073380547", "0321545869", "1285057090", "0132576252", "0312644205", "0321696727"], "bought_together": ["158503780X"], "buy_after_viewing": ["0132576252", "0321545885", "0136022537", "1133112285"]}, "price": 81.76, "salesRank": {"Books": 504138}, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41B2gXx57hL.jpg", "categories": [["Books"]]}{"asin": "013292143X", "title": "Plumbing Level 1 Trainee Guide, Paperback (4th Edition)", "price": 34.5, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41ED4xSBUUL.jpg", "related": {"also_bought": ["1609830539", "0133148505", "0136086373", "0132569582", "1605252360", "0136144160", "1938936183", "0136086365", "1938936264", "1580019048", "0132273012", "0131091832", "0132285967", "0132292688", "0133402533", "1605253081", "0136023037", "0132285916", "160983108X", "0826905129", "1285061020"], "bought_together": ["1609830539"], "buy_after_viewing": ["0131091786", "1589237005", "1609830539", "B003F76K0O"]}, "salesRank": {"Books": 405715}, "categories": [["Books"]]}{"asin": "0132915545", "description": "R.C.

In an ambitious effort, Michael Lovelady demonstrates a better way to minimize downside portfolio risk while achieving higher risk-adjusted yields. Lovelady does not dismiss MPT but blends it with quantitative investing to fill the void between theory and reality through his skillful development of synthetic annuity strategies. While there are no panaceas in life, synthetic annuities seem to offer a significant improvement over conventional wisdom.&rdquo;--Donald M. DePamphilis, Ph.D, Clinical Professor of Finance, Loyola Marymount University; and author ofMergers, Acquisitions, and Other Restructuring Activities, Sixth Edition&ldquo;The author brings together the best of both the options and stock worlds in this very practical book. Smarter than most hedge funds, he spells out specific strategies and how to deal with inevitable problems. Unlike most fluff trading books, you&rsquo;ll know what you are doing and why you are doing it. By the time you are done, you will definitely reevaluate the strategy behind your own portfolio.&nbsp; What more can you ask for in any book?&rdquo;--Michael Benklifa, author ofProfiting with Iron Condor Options, President of Othello Consulting&ldquo;Michael Lovelady explains a range of options strategies in a concise and clear manner to help you rethink your approach to risk and timing, and to the overall market as well. Michael shows why options should not be relegated to trading accounts, or the 5% to 10% normally allocated to alternative investments, but have an important role to play across all aspects of the portfolio.

Thomsett, author ofOptions Trading for the Conservative InvestorOptions-based &ldquo;synthetic annuities&rdquo;&nbsp; give investors the ability to generate higher returns, provide better downside protection, and utilize risk more efficiently than pure stock and bond-based portfolios. Now, this strategy&rsquo;s creator shows exactly how to use them to support a wide range of trading and investing goals.Hedge fund manager Michael Lovelady shows how synthetic annuities blend the best features of traditional portfolios with the risk management discipline of quantitative investing, increasing current yields while also reducing volatility.Michael presents this new strategy with unique graphics and simplified models that any investor or trader can use, and demonstrates its value in the context of today&rsquo;s key market trends.

Now, three leading experts help you understand these macrotrends, anticipate and assess their potential impact to your business, systematically mitigate emerging risks, and leverage new opportunities for sustainable profit.&nbsp;The authors help you plan for continued population growth and migration; the growing buying power of rising economies; broader and deeper global connectivity; national geopolitical activities aimed at protecting access to natural resources; and the likely impacts of environmental and climate change. They offer actionable insights for virtually all supply-chain related decisions: from locating plants and warehouses to prioritizing markets, designing products, and choosing suppliers.&nbsp;This book focuses squarely on the emerging global demographic, economic, and environmental macrotrends that will powerfully impact your supply chain&mdash;helping you anticipate problems, mitigate risk, and build long-term competitive advantage. Three prominent supply chain authors illuminate each of these game-changing issues and present an analysis for anticipating market opportunities and solving the supply chain problems they will cause.&nbsp;You&rsquo;ll find actionable recommendations and insights for systematically mitigating disruptions that are expected to become frequent, long-lasting, and severe. The authors help you answer questions like:How do you manage supply and demand in a world marked by massive demographic and economic shifts? How do you secure the supplies you need to grow your business when resources are severely constrained and nations are aggressively attempting to lock them down? How do you choose the right products, suppliers, and markets&mdash;and abandon the wrong ones?&nbsp;The authors provide interconnected strategies and recommendations you leverage immediately&mdash;improving short-term performance as you prepare for longer-term issues. Whatever your operational role, this book will help you build a supply chain that is more resilient, more sustainable, and far more competitive in a transforming world.&nbsp;PLANNING:Manage supply and demand uncertainties as well as imbalances more effectivelySOURCING/PROCUREMENT:Overcome growing scarcities of natural resourcesPRODUCTION:Prepare for disrupted process flowsTRANSPORTATION/LOGISTICS:Anticipate congestion and infrastructure decay[if gte mso 9]> <xml> </xml> <![endif][if gte mso 10]> <![endif]", "title": "Global Macrotrends and Their Impact on Supply Chain Management: Strategies for Gaining Competitive Advantage (FT Press Operations Management)", "related": {"also_bought": ["0470531886", "007176626X", "0749468084", "0071798307", "0133017370", "0262018454", "0071827420", "0133367231", "0133448754", "0273730223", "0415822548", "1422162605", "0133088014", "0133449092", "0749463694"], "bought_together": ["0470531886", "0071798307"], "buy_after_viewing": ["1422149366"]}, "price": 18.88, "salesRank": {"Books": 1301951}, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51u0uIqmIdL.jpg", "categories": [["Books"]]}{"asin": "0132938669", "title": "Cisco Icnd2 Official Cert Guide with Myitcertificationlabs Bundle (640-816)", "price": 40.49, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/511SngFstzL.jpg", "related": {"buy_after_viewing": ["1587204355"]}, "salesRank": {"Books": 3068444}, "categories": [["Books"]]}{"asin": "0132950960", "description": "Michael Parkinis Professor Emeritus in the Department of Economics at the University of Western Ontario, Canada.

Whether you prefer long or short positions, in, at, or out of the money, or volatility plays, you cannot ignore the importance of this work. I recommend this book to all serious options traders.&rdquo;--Michael C. Thomsett, author,Options Trading for the Conservative Investor, second edition, andThe Options Trading Body of KnowledgeDetailed strategies supported by comprehensive analysis of the actual data: not cherry-picked anecdotes or guessworkFor option investors seeking market-neutral strategies and stock investors who want to hedge earnings risksOption trading on earnings reports offers immense profit opportunities, if you know how. For the first time ever, there&rsquo;s a comprehensive, evidence-based guide to profiting from these trades. This guide reflects analysis of the full universe of all equity options contracts traded over 14 years: objective, empirical results based on millions of observations. The authors distill this unique data set into knowledge you can immediately apply to identify trades with high profit potential and low market risk.Zhou and Shon demonstrate the impact of changes to holding periods, strike prices, expiration months, and other factors. Next, they walk through diverse approaches based on options trades made before, during, and after earnings announcements. Finally, they explore ways to improve profitability by identifying characteristics of securities most likely to support profitable earnings-related trades--even drilling down to specific industries and the impact of analysts&rsquo; forecasts.By trading on corporate earnings, investors can potentially profit in both up and down markets. Moreover, such strategies avoid taking market risk during non-event periods. Now, two leading traders and portfolio managers present detailed, specific, actionable techniques any moderately experienced investor can use to capture these sizable profits.Ping Zhou and John Shon have performed an unprecedented empirical analysis of thousands of companies, reviewing tens of millions of data points associated with option prices, earnings announcement returns, and fundamentals. They have identified consistent opportunities associated with focusing on the magnitude of the market&rsquo;s reaction to earnings, not necessarily its direction. Drawing on this extraordinary body of work, they offer concrete guidance for improving the likelihood of making correct forecasts and managing the risks of incorrect forecasts. Their analysis is based on solid, empirical evidence rather than selective anecdotes, which lends higher credibility to their recommendations. Their quantitative work also helps investors better quantify and manage risks.Option Strategies for Earnings Announcementsintroduces valuable new ways to exploit option trading opportunities around earnings news, illuminates crucial issues most investors have never considered, and explores aspects of earnings-related option trading that have never been empirically examined before. Whether you&rsquo;re an options investor seeking profitable market-neutral strategies or an equity investor who wants to hedge earnings-related risk, it provides the end-of-quarter advantage you&rsquo;ve been searching for.Let the data surprise you--and follow where it leadsProfit from historical evidence you (and the rest of the market) didn&rsquo;t expectMaster volatility-based earnings tradesTrade on the magnitude of earnings-based moves, not their directionRide post-earnings-announcement drift to greater profitsOutperform by combining the right securities with the right strategiesUse advanced analysis to significantly improve your oddsExploit implied volatility, market cap, valuation, industry effects, and historical earnings announcement returns to improve the probabilities of profitable trades&nbsp;", "title": "Option Strategies for Earnings Announcements: A Comprehensive, Empirical Analysis", "related": {"also_bought": ["0692028293", "0137084927", "0132354691", "0137029039", "0071775145", "111861612X", "1118347137", "0984638709", "1118133161", "1118590767", "0135058724", "0615946216", "1491249390", "0137085516", "0393244660", "111867913X", "1118464222", "0133065308", "0071813101", "0615308147", "1118164377", "1118410858", "0615857884", "1489582401", "0470889667", "155738486X", "1118072693", "0132900432", "0071381562", "0071818774", "0470920157", "0470481617", "159280392X", "1118043561", "0857193007", "1118435796", "0470933089", "0131710664", "0071807225", "0071465057", "1614271690", "1118066618", "1118273044", "1607964198", "0133409031", "1118273052", "1118273028", "0071443045", "0452298628", "1461444896", "1466307145", "1118164342", "0470181990", "1118129857", "1118407245", "0071629653", "0470618981", "0730376834", "1118692640", "1453674764"], "bought_together": ["0137084927"], "buy_after_viewing": ["0137084927", "0470243759", "155738486X", "0131710664"]}, "price": 41.95, "salesRank": {"Books": 950995}, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51HVBoSqsOL.jpg", "categories": [["Books"]]}{"asin": "0132947218", "description": "&ldquo;Behavioral investing is the next frontier.&rdquo;&ndash;Joshua Steiner, Managing Director, Hedgeye Risk Management&nbsp;&ldquo;A thought-provoking piece that is a &lsquo;must read&rsquo; for investors of all types.&rdquo;&ndash;Randy Johanneck, former Chief Risk Officer, J.P.

InTime the Markets, Charles D. Kirkpatrick, II, offers a systematic, practical, and accessible methodology for identifying probable shifts in business cycles.&nbsp;Overcoming the divide between fundamental and technical analysis, Kirkpatrick tests twenty-five publicly available economic indicators and identifies only three that, taken together, usually signal major market movements. You&rsquo;ll learn which fundamental, economic, monetary, sentiment, and price data indicators work best&ndash;and which to avoid as redundant, time consuming, and only marginally helpful.&nbsp;Kirkpatrick explains why market timing is crucial to reducing risk, reviews evidence about whether markets can be timed, and presents methods for neutralizing the risks of market decline. Next, he introduces easy-to-use technical methods for establishing where trends and oscillations are beginning or ending. Finally, he walks through tests of economic indicators to determine when markets are most likely to change direction&ndash;so you can ride the waves in rising markets and step aside when they plummet.&nbsp;&bull;Beyond the flawed Efficient Markets HypothesisWhy market data shows that markets can be timed&nbsp;&bull;What you need to know about trends, momentum, and cyclesA quick technical analysis primer for long-term investors&nbsp;&bull;Timing systems that work: building, testing, and using themCompiling your data and transforming it into usable insights", "title": "Time the Markets: Using Technical Analysis to Interpret Economic Data, Revised Edition", "related": {"also_bought": ["0132439786", "013259661X", "0137059442", "1489542825", "0471770884", "1492174807", "148950771X", "1118728513", "1118464222", "0071800514", "0137010230", "0857193007", "0471668265", "0071544194", "0133092607", "0470516704", "1557385270", "1470110970", "1118245288", "0132900432", "0471980218", "1118544528", "007178568X", "1118166507", "1118407741", "1118343484", "1430244798", "0071465057", "1118343549", "1484137450", "0470540850", "0470138971", "0930233107", "0470933097", "0137079303", "0132734389", "0071410678", "111867913X", "0071363904", "0273722093", "1118027736", "0470178426", "007175492X", "0070120579", "047013772X", "1742169309", "0471381357", "0977375714"], "bought_together": ["0132439786", "013259661X"], "buy_after_viewing": ["0137059442", "013259661X", "0132439786", "1118544528"]}, "price": 26.24, "salesRank": {"Books": 1123226}, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51scnGR4psL.jpg", "categories": [["Books"]]}{"asin": "0132900432", "description": "[if gte mso 9]> <xml> Normal 0 false false false MicrosoftInternetExplorer4 </xml> <![endif][if gte mso 9]> <xml> </xml> <![endif][if gte mso 10]> <![endif]&ldquo;Finally!
